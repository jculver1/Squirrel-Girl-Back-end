# Squirrel-Girl-Back-end

Squirrel Girl app (front-end), to see backend checkout this repository: https://github.com/jculver1/Squirrel-Girl-Back-end

Reason for this app:

"Squirrel Girl, Squirrel Girl! She's a human and also squirrel! Can she climb up a tree? Yes she can, easily. That's whyyyy, her name is Squirrel Girl!"

A fun little web app, filled with amazing rememberable quotes from Squirrel Girl. The app allows the user to click through cards that contain a photo and quote.

Future implementations: Make a CRUD app that allows the user to add and update images and quotes. Maybe delete...

Technologies: React node.js Express.js Knex.js PSQL Bootstrap
